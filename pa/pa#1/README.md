# Project Assignment 1 (PA1)
* Total points: **45 points**
* Deadline: 2 weeks
* This is a project assignment which will be submitted by each team.
* You have the following documents to be done and submitted:\
## Project plan (20 points)
* You are required to draft an initial version of your project plan. After submitting this version, the TA’s will review and provide feedback. Based on the feedback, you will update and submit again in the next assignment (PA2).
* The project plan document follows the template provided in Moodle. The plan should follow the overall plan detailed in **LN04 – Project Assignments**. You may want to check an example of the document at [Link](http://sce.uhcl.edu/helm/RationalUnifiedProcess/examples/csports/ovu_webex.htm.)
* In this PA1, the project plan is NOT required to be fully complete in this Inception phase. Instead, your team SHOULD fill out relevant information for the following sections:
  * 1 Introduction: be brief
  * 2 Project Overview (and its subsections): be brief
  * 3 Project Organization (and its subsections)
  * 4.2 Project Plan (and its subsections)
  * 4.3 Project Monitoring and Control: Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.3. Leave Section 4.3.2 blank for now.
* When using the template, remember to remove the [blue italic texts] and replace them with your texts in normal format (black and normal font, use font 10, Times New Roman). For the other sections, remove the blue texts and keep them empty.
* For Section 4.2, make sure the content is consistent with Sprints/Iterations specified in **LN04 – Project Assignments** and your plan in Trello:
  * Section 4.2.1: every project will have 3 phases (Inception, Elaboration and Construction) and 4 Iteration/Sprints.
  * Section 4.2.2: specify how many builds you will produce for testing and when you will produce.
  * Section 4.2.3: detail the phases and iterations/sprints according to the lecture note **LN04 -- Project Assignments**. Use MS Project to detail the schedule and copy it to this section, but make sure that this schedule is consistent with the sprints plan in Trello. In the schedule, you need to detail tasks and assign those tasks to team members. This schedule can be changed in the future.
## Vision document (20 points)
* Prepare an initial version of the vision document for your project using the vision document template provided in Moodle.
* Try to fill out all the sections with the information you have at this time, but you are not required to fully complete the document.
* Similar to the project plan, you will update the vision document again after this assignment.
