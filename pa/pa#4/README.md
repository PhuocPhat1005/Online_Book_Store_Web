# Project Assignment 4 (PA4)
* Total scores: **35 points**
* Deadline: 2 weeks
* This is a project assignment which will be submitted by each team.
* You have the following documents to be done and submitted.
## Revise SAD (15 points)
* Your team is asked to revise the Software Architecture Document (SAD) that you submitted in PA3. Your team needs to update Sections 1-4 and fill the content for Sections 5 and 6, based on the feedback for PA3 from the TA’s and more information you have about your project now.
* For Section 5, draw a deployment diagram(s) using UML and describe briefly each node. Note that the deployment diagram in UML consists of nodes that run your system’s components and sub-systems and links among them. For example, if your system runs only on Android devices, without servers, then the diagram has only one node. If your system is a Web-based application, it typically has to run on one or more Web servers, desktop-based Web clients, and mobile Web clients, so the deployment diagram should have three nodes connecting each other via Internet (either HTTP or HTTPS protocols).
* For Section 6, provide structures for folders that store your code and supporting files. For example, you have a Web server, provide a folder structure for source code and supporting files on your Web server. Let’s just focus on the main folders only. The folder structure can look like a folder structure on Windows.
## UI prototype (15 points)
* Your team needs to sketch the user interface for the system your team is designing. You can use Figma, Microsoft Visio or other tools such as https://moqups.com and https://fluidui.com to design the UI. You need to sketch the UI for the main screen and at least 2 screens for the key scenarios. The key scenarios must follow what you describe in the use-case specifications.
* For each screen, you need to describe its purpose, what it shows and how users can use it. To do so, you can copy all screens to MS Word and provide the description below each screen.
## Weekly report (5 points)
* Planning meeting, weekly meetings, review meeting. Follow instructions in the “GoogleDriveFolderStructureRequirement” file.
## Submission Guidelines
* You must copy all documents to the directory named PA4-Group[GroupId] and compress the whole directory to the zip/rar file named PA4-Group[GroupId].zip/.rar.
* For example: PA4-Group01.zip
## Grading Criteria
* The assignment will be graded according to how well your team prepares the required documents using the information your team has at this time. Criteria include:
  * English writing: easy to understand, few errors.
  * Well formatted texts, diagrams, charts.
  * Level of completeness of the documents, based on the information available at this time.
  * The software architecture must capture key components necessary for the system.
  * Class diagrams must include key classes, attributes, operations, and relationships.
  * The UI design must match the use-cases modeled in the previous assignments.
  * The UI has sufficient elements (labels, controls, etc.) for users to complete their tasks.
