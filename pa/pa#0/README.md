  * Target users and environments: who are your app’s users, what environments they will use (devices, OS, Web, etc.)
  * Key features: list the key features for the app.
* You may talk to the TAs so that they can provide you suggestions or feedback on your proposed project. After submitting, TAs will review your proposal and approve or suggest changing it.
## Tools setup
* Deadline: To be determined
* One of the main goals of this project assignment is to help you practice teamwork for professional software development. We will assess and evaluate your effectiveness in team collaboration. Everyone is required to work closely with others on the group to deliver results. And we will use tools to monitor and assess each group’s teamwork performance.
* You are required to use the following tools:
    * **Moodle**: used for posting and submitting assignments.
    * **Facebook group**: used for general notifications, class discussions, and questions/answers. This group includes everyone from both classes. Please join the group. If you are NOT using Facebook, please let us know so that we can have an alternative way of notifying you.
    * **Slack**: used for discussions and interactions among group members for each project.
      * TAs will create a Slack project and add all students to this project. 
      * There will be a general channel for everyone, and it will be used for general project discussions.
      * Each group will have a channel that is linked to Trello. Any updates from Trello will be updated on this channel. Group members must use this channel to discuss their projects.
      * Slack has applications on desktop and mobile, please open the app and check it frequently.
    * **Jira**: Firstly, each student creates an account in Jira. Secondly, each group leader creates a free project in Jira. The name of the project should be in IntroSE-<ClassID> - <GroupID> format, for example, Intro2SE-20CLC02-Group05. Thirdly, each group leader adds group members into the project. Then, TAs will provide their Jira emails (not FIT emails). Finally, each group leader adds TA into the project. We will apply the Scrum model in the projects. All tasks, including documenting tasks, self-training tasks, coding tasks must be logged on Jira with their working times. Groups must paste the screenshots of all tasks on weekly reports.
    * **Github/Bitbucket/Gitlab**: used to store source code and documentation. Each group will be belonging to a team/repository on Github/Bitbucket/Gitlab and has the following folders (your repos should be in private mode):
      * **/src**: used to store source code
      * **/docs**: used to store documentations, which has the following folders
        * **management**: storing planning documents, reports (weekly report, project status report, etc.)
        * **requirements**: storing all requirements, including vision document and use cases
        * **analysis and design**: storing all analysis and design related documents, including software architecture document, UML models, UI design
        * **test**: storing all test documents such as test plan, test cases, test reports
      * **/pa**: including subfolders to store submissions. Each subfolder contains one PA submission.
    * TAs will help set up these tools during the first few lab sessions.
