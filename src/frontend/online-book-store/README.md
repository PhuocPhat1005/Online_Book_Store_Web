# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Frontend Setup

To ensure that the frontend of this project works correctly, you need to install all the necessary libraries and dependencies. Follow the steps below to set up the frontend environment:

### 1. Install Node.js and npm

Make sure that Node.js and npm - Node Package Manager are installed on your system. You can download and install them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Navigate to the project directory where the `package.json` file is located.

```bash
cd src/frontend/online-book-store
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Use npm to install all the required frontend libraries. These dependencies are listed in the package.json file. To install them, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Verify Installation

Once the installation is complete, you can verify that everything is set up correctly by starting the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the frontend application, and you can access it typically at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Adding or Updating Frontend Libraries

-   To install an extra library you can run:

```bash
npm install library_name
```

This will install the `library_name` and add it to the `package.json` file automatically.

-   To update an existing library you can run:

```bash
npm update library_name
```

This will update the `library_name` to the latest version.
